This set of bar charts visualizes key demographic factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, test preparation course completion, and parental education levels. These factors help identify diverse backgrounds and potentially underserved groups, offering insights into how demographic variables may contribute to performance gaps.



 **Parental Education Level and Count**
A chart showing the number of students with each level of parental education. This visualization indicates a correlation between parental education and student performance. Most students have parents with some college education or an associate degree, and higher parental education often aligns with higher student scores.


 **Average Scores by Parental Education Levels**
A horizontal bar chart displaying average scores in math, reading, and writing, grouped by parental education level. The chart shows that students with parents holding higher degrees tend to achieve better scores, highlighting the influence of parental education on academic outcomes.

 **Comparison of Lunch Types**
A bar chart showing the number of students by lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced). This visualization helps illustrate socioeconomic disparities, as students on reduced lunch programs may face additional challenges affecting their performance.

### 4. Math, Reading, and Writing Scores by Race/Ethnicity

The count of students in each category suggests socioeconomic differences within the dataset, as students on free/reduced lunch programs may face additional challenges impacting their performance. The visualization highlights potential socioeconomic factors that could influence academic outcomes.



## Feature Engineering and Selection
Based on the insights from EDA, several key features were selected or engineered to improve model accuracy. New features such as parental education level were included, and existing features were transformed to capture complex relationships within the data.

## Modeling
To create a robust predictive model, several machine learning algorithms were evaluated. Each model was chosen based on its ability to capture specific data patterns, its interpretability, and suitability for the dataset.

1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Description**: Serves as a baseline model, assuming a linear relationship between predictors and math scores.
   - **Strengths**: Simple and interpretable, making it easy to understand the influence of each feature on the target.
   - **Limitations**: Limited in capturing non-linear relationships in data.
   
2. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
   - **Ridge Regression**: Adds L2 regularization to reduce overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
   - **Lasso Regression**: Employs L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

3. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - **Description**: A non-linear model that splits the dataset into branches, making decisions at each node based on feature values.

4. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Description**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees, averaging their outputs for improved performance.
   
...(and so on for each model)

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of squared errors, emphasizing larger errors.
- **R-Squared (R²)**: The proportion of variance explained by the model, indicating overall model fit.

## Results and Insights
After evaluation, Linear Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.5%. Key insights include:
- **Significant Predictors**: Parental education level and study time were consistently significant predictors of math scores.
- **Actionable Findings**: The results suggest that increasing parental support and study time can positively impact student performance.
